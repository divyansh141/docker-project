# docker-project

To work this project properly,
you have to put whole content of website directory in the volume that has been created by docker-compose.yml

In our case,
The created volume will be mycompose_web-storage/_data
You have to put all those files in above vollume.
That's it.
You are all set.
THANK YOU !!!!
